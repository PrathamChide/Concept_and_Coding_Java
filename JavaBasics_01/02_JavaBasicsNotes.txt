What is Method?
- Method is used to perform certain task
- It's a collection of instruction that perform some specific task
- It can be used to bring the code readability and re-usability.

How to declare a method
public int sum(int a, int b) throws Exception{
    //method body
}

1. Access Specifiers
public - can access through any class in any package
private - can be accessed by methods only in the same class
protected - can be access by other class in same package or other subclasses in different package
default - If we don't mention anything, then default access specifier is used by Java. It can be only accessed by classes in
same package

2. Return Type
- Method do not return anything use "void"
- Use class name or primitive data types as type of the method

3. Method Name
- It should be verb (some kind of action)
- Should start with small letter and follow camel case in case of multiple words

4. Parameters
- It's a list of variables that will be used in the method.
- Parameter list can be blank too.

5. Method body
- Method body get finished when you call "return" in the mid.
- Get Finished when reached to the end.
- You can also stop method by "return" even for void return type

Types of Method
- User Defined Method
- Overloaded Method
- Overridden Method
- Static Method
- Final Method
- Abstract Method
- System Defined Method

1. System Defined Method
Methods which are already defined and ready to use in Java like Math.sqrt().

2. User Defined Method
Methods which programmer creates based upon the program necessary.

3. Overloaded Method ---> Static binding ----> Polymorphism
More than One Method with same name is created in same class

4. Overridden Method ----> Dynamic binding ----> Polymorphism
Subclass has the same method as the parent class

5. Static Method
- These methods are associated with the class.
- Can be called with class name
- static methods cannot access non static instance and methods
- static method cannot be overridden

*When to declare method static:
- Methods which do not modify the state of the object can be declared static.
- Utility method which do not use any instance variable and compute only on arguments
Ex:- Factory Design Pattern

6. Final Method
- Final Method cannot be overridden in Java.
- Why? final method means its implementation cannot be changed. If child class cannot be changed.
If class cannot change its implementation then no used of overriding

7. Abstract Method
- It is defined only in abstract class
- only method declaration is done.
- Its implementation is done in child class

8. Variable Arguments(VARARGS):
- Variable number of inputs in the parameters
- Only one variable argument can be present in the method
- It should be the last argument in the list

Constructors in Depth:-
- It is used to create an Instance/ initialize the instance variable
- It's similar to method expect:
    - Name: Constructor name is same as Class Name
    - Return Type: Constructor do not have any return type
    - Constructor cannot be static or final or abstract, synchronized.

Types of Constructor:
- Default
- No Argument
- Parameterized
- Constructor Overloaded
- Private Constructor
- Constructor Chaining
    - this
    - super

FAQs in Interviews
- Why constructor do not have return type?
- Why constructor cannot be final?
- Why constructor cannot be abstract?
- Why constructor cannot be static?
- Can we define constructor in interface
- Why constructor name is same as of class

1. final -> method with final cannot be overridden

Note: If we define Constructor any constructor, default constructor is not added.
